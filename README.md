# CrimeMap
Flask+React+GoogleMaps
The user should
be able to submit new crimes by choosing a location for the map and entering a
date, category, and description of the crime. The user should also be able to view
all the previously recorded crimes as icons on the map and more details about any
specific crime by selecting the relevant icon from the map. The point of the map is to
be able to easily view areas with high crime rates as well as to assist investigators in
detecting patterns and trends in crime.
